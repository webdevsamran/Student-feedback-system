Student feedback system

Student feedback system
Introduction
Student Feedback System for college students have been developed which aims to rate and analyse the college faculty’s performance.


This type of Student Feedback system reduces, the strenuous work of physically examining the feedback pages of each and every student.


The system also reduces the burden of efforts and burden of keeping and maintaining the records on a manual base, it requires a lot of space and safety to keep up such records.

Also the students feedbacks can be tempered for wrong reasons in case of paper based feedbacks wherein the SFS will always ensure safety of feedbacks privacy.




Another important features of the SFS is that physical presence of neither the admin nor the student is required for the either giving the feedback nor for assessing the feedback.

Also further enhancement can be done and more features can be added for better retrieval of the feedback details.
